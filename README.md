    <h4 align="left">Future Updates</h3>
    <p align="left">
    1. Complete redevelopment of code. This was developed some time ago, and with the new skills I have acquired, CozmoBoost can be pushed much further. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Adding a timer and the subsequent countdown screen animations.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. Adding a setup/settings window to allow users to customise various features. These may include changing Cozmos voice speed and pitch, weather region, etc. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. Adding more screen animations for all current and future features.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. Adding various other features that currently exist for the robot Vector (This is what CozmoBoost is inspired from).

    <h4 align="left">Requirements</h4>
    <p align="left">
    Python version 3.6 to run the code due to the Cozmo library not being updated in recent years to support later versions of Python.
